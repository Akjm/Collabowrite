# Collabowrite
Collabowrite is a multiplayer experience inpsired by the classic campfire game of "one word at a time story". After typing in your sentence, pass the keyboard along to another user to write theirs. At the end of the game, view the most likely convoluted plot all at once.

Uses bootstrap and a theme for bootstrape called paper.
